        <p>My name is Manthan Chauhan, I'm a Web Developer and Competitive Programmer, and an occasional Technical Content Writer on Geeksforgeeks & Medium. At the moment, I'm a B.tech undergrad in Electronics & Communication at Indraprastha University, Delhi, and will be graduating this year (2020).</p>
        <p>I started my programming journey with Competitive Programming at Codechef.com, with C & C++. After that, I started developing small to medium level projects using Python. Primarily I'm a Backend Developer in Django, but I also have some experience in Frontend Development and DevOps.</p>
        <p>This Online Portfolio Maker is my biggest solo project by now, which has encouraged me to expand my skill set into various domains. In case you're having any issues, or have discovered any bug, I'd appreciate you to let me know about the same through the Feedback form.</p>
